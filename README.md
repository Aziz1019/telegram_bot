# Wikipedia Bot

Good day everybody!

This is just a simple Wikipedia Telegram Bot, which works the same as official Wikipedia. You type the name of the topic and it finds relevant info.

Note that in bot file you should change the API_TOKEN to your new bot's token. New API Token should be taken from Telegram's BotFather while creating a new bot.

Happy Coding)
